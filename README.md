The Game of Life - A Pebble Watch Face
======================================

This is Conway's Game of Life simulation in the form of a watch face. It supports both 12 and 24 hour formats. 

The game starts with 50% of the 572 "cells" populated in a random order. The game resets/repopulates automatically each minute, or can be reset manually by changing watch faces, then changing back.
